You're going to love CheatSheets!

## List of CheatSheets
* Git Cheat Sheet
* SQL Cheat Sheet
* More to come

## Getting Started
The cheat sheets are all written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) using a tabular view style. Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`. You can learn more about Markdown in GitHub's Guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

You can clone the cheat sheet(s) to your local machine or fork the cheat sheet(s) to your remote repository. They can be used as guides that can be referenced when the need arises during your programming sessions.

## Contributing
CheatSheets is still an evolving project with a lot of work still required to make it outstanding. Contributions are welcome to CheatSheets in the form of error-correction, cheat sheet addition or any other form of contribution to make CheatSheets industry standard.

If you'd like to contribute code to CheatSheets, fork the repository and open a Pull Request!

We are very responsive to contributors, and review every patch we receive fairly quickly. Most contributors who successfully get a patch or two applied are given write access to the repositories and invited to join CheatSheets' development team. Since we view every user as potential contributor, this approach works well for us.

So if you want to help out with CheatSheets, we'll be glad to accept your efforts!
