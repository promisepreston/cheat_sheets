# CheatSheets
CheatSheets is a collection of various cheat sheets of applications, dependencies, frameworks, languages and runtimes such as Chef, Docker, Git, Ruby, Rails and many others. The cheat sheets are regularly updated, and new ones are added to the list.

You're going to love CheatSheets!

## List of CheatSheets
* Git Cheat Sheet
* SQL Cheat Sheet
* More to come

## Getting Started
The cheat sheets are all written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) using a tabular view style. Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`. You can learn more about Markdown in GitHub's Guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

You can clone the cheat sheet(s) to your local machine or fork the cheat sheet(s) to your remote repository. They can be used as guides that can be referenced when the need arises during your programming sessions.

## Contributing
CheatSheets is still an evolving project with a lot of work still required to make it outstanding. Contributions are welcome to CheatSheets in the form of error-correction, cheat sheet addition or any other form of contribution to make CheatSheets industry standard.

If you'd like to contribute code to CheatSheets, please do the following:


1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new topic branch off the master branch
3. Commit and push the branch
4. Make a pull request describing what you have done
5. Now it will hopefully get merged

**Note**: For now there is no styling guide for CheatSheets, but you can look through the various cheat sheets to have a feel of the styles that were adopted in creating the cheat sheets.

We are very responsive to contributors, and review every patch we receive fairly quickly. Most contributors who successfully get a patch or two applied are given write access to the repositories and invited to join CheatSheets' development team. Since we view every user as potential contributor, this approach works well for us.
